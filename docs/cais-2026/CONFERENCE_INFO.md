## Research Focus

The conference emphasizes rigorous, reproducible research on compound AI architectures, optimization, and deployment.

### Four Research Pillars

1. **Architectural Patterns & Composition**
   - Networks of networks
   - Inference-time scaling
   - Verifier-based systems
   - RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
   - Multi-agent systems
   - Tool-augmented designs

2. **System Optimization & Efficiency**
   - End-to-end optimization
   - Cost-performance trade-offs
   - Resource allocation
   - Automated architecture search

3. **Engineering & Operations**
   - MLOps for compound AI
   - Monitoring and debugging
   - Security
   - Production case studies

4. **Evaluation & Benchmarking**
   - Performance metrics
   - Reproducibility frameworks
   - Real-world impact assessment

## Submission Requirements

- **Formatting:** ACM template compliance required (templates available on ACM website)
- **Review Process:** Peer-reviewed research track with artifact-centric review
- **Reproducibility:** ACM reproducibility badging taxonomy adopted to recognize transparent, deployable research

## Program Components

# app.build Collaboration between Databricks Codegen team and THWS CAIRO Lab

This repository contains paper submissions and supporting materials for app.build prompt to application agent.

## Paper: Production Reliability at Scale: Scaffolding Systems for Agentic Prompt-to-App Generation

### About the Collaboration

This submission is a collaborative research effort between **Databricks - app.build team** and **THWS University of Applied Sciences WÃ¼rzburg-Schweinfurt (CAIRO Lab)**, exploring how environment scaffolding transforms LLMs into production-ready software engineering agents. The research presents empirical evidence from the app.build platform - an open-source prompt-to-app generator that demonstrates systematic reliability improvements through structured environment design.

### The app.build Tool

[app.build](https://app.build) is an open-source prompt-to-app generation platform (developed by  Databricks - app.build team) that enables reliable production deployment of AI-generated applications through:
- FSM-guided multi-agent orchestration
- Multi-layered validation pipelines
- Structured error recovery and feedback loops
- Production-grade quality gates
